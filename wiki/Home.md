# fastapi_advanced_filters

Type-safe, declarative filtering for FastAPI with first-class SQLAlchemy support.

- Define filters once, map to SQLAlchemy columns, and get out-of-the-box query conditions, sorting, selection, q-search, and pagination.
- Pydantic v2 models with a metaclass generate filter schemas from a simple `FilterConfig`.
